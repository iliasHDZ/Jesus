# 1.2.0
- And on the ninth day:
    - God could not play the bell sound effect consistently, so He took matters into His own hands. (And now there's a volume setting for it as well.)
    - God also realized that the mod kept crashing in the level editor on Windows (and sometimes on Android), so He dropped support for it. (Level editor support in macOS is unaffected.)
    - God also realized Jesus was a null texture on Android, and He decided to do something about it. (No more generic fallback texture!)
    - God increased Jesus' picture quality by a tad smidge. (He was unable to pay the outrageous $14.50 USD fee Shutterstock demanded for the full quality image, and had to settle for less. Imagine if sales tax was included!)
# 1.1.1
- God made a mistake with His function hooks.
# 1.1.0
- And on the eighth day God realized that Jesus wanted to be on macOS and Android; and he let Jesus do so on the eighth day.
